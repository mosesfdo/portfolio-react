# 🧠 Portfolio React — Personal Developer Portfolio

## 🎯 What's This?

This is more than just a portfolio.

It started as a simple project to learn React better—ended up becoming a fully responsive, animated site that shows what I can actually build.

It's my playground for trying new libraries, refining design logic, and pushing production-ready components.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

- **To level up** in modern frontend (React 19, Vite, animations, canvas, etc.)
- **To create a portfolio** that feels like me—interactive, smooth, polished
- **To turn ideas into something** scrollable, clickable, and real
- **To build instead of just learning** passively

This project is not just a showcase—it's proof of what I can build when I'm given the tools and freedom to create.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & What I Learned

### Core Stack
- **React 19** — Latest hooks and state patterns
- **Vite** — Fast builds, smooth dev server
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — Clean, modular JS

### Animations & UX
- **Framer Motion** — Animations that feel alive
- **Lenis** — Smooth scroll (like butter)
- **Canvas API** — Custom wave animation

### Styling
- **CSS3** — Grids, flex, animations, custom props
- **Responsive Design** — Looks right on all screen sizes
- **Dark UI** — My preferred aesthetic

### Dev Workflow
- **Component architecture** — Reusable + clean
- **Performance optimization** — Only what's needed
- **Modern tools** — ESLint, Prettier, Git

## 🎨 Key Features

### Visuals & UI
- **TiltedCard** — 3D tilt effect on hover
- **Waves** — Animated canvas-based wave at the bottom
- **SocialIcons** — Clean animated social links
- **Dark theme** — Modern + readable
- **Micro-interactions** — Hover states, smooth transitions

### UX & Navigation
- **Smooth scroll** via Lenis
- **Floating nav bar**
- **Fully responsive** (desktop, tablet, mobile)

### UX Enhancements
- **Micro-interactions** — Engaging transitions and hover effects
- **Reduced Motion Fallback** — Accessibility-aware animations
- **Lazy Loading** — Performance enhancement for media and animations

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
# Clone it
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Go in
cd portfolio-react

# Install everything
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build it
npm run build
```

## 📈 What I Got Out of It

- **Hands-on React 19 experience** (hooks, refs, patterns)
- **Built reusable animated components** from scratch
- **Learned the Canvas API** for interactive graphics
- **Created a responsive UI system** with modern CSS
- **Improved app performance** and animation control
- **Designed with UX first**, not just code

## 🧩 Custom Components

### 🃏 TiltedCard
- Real-time mouse tracking
- 3D tilt with smooth spring effects
- Overlay support
- **Based on a ReactBits template** → modified & tuned

### 🌊 Waves
- Canvas + Perlin noise
- Configurable settings
- Mouse reactive
- Clean performance on all devices
- **Also started from ReactBits**, but heavily customized

## 📱 Responsive Design

The portfolio is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop** — Full interactive experience with all animations
- **Tablet** — Adapted layouts and touch interactions
- **Mobile** — Simplified interactions and mobile-optimized navigation

Tested across multiple screen sizes using Chrome DevTools, Firefox Responsive View, and real devices.

## 🔧 Configs Used

- `vite.config.js` → Dev + prod builds
- `eslint.config.js` → Lint rules
- `package.json` → Scripts and dependencies

## ⏭️ Coming Soon

- **TypeScript rewrite**
- **Unit + integration tests**
- **Accessibility improvements**
- **SEO with metadata**
- **Lighthouse optimization**

## 🤝 Credits

- **ReactBits** → Initial template for TiltedCard & Waves
- **Framer Motion** → For animations
- **Lenis** → For buttery scroll

## 📄 License

This is a personal learning + showcase project.

Use the code, but give credit where it's due.
